# DTW-Signature-Recognition
This is the code for a signature recognition application that demonstrates the practical usage of Machine Learning Augmented Dynamic Time Warping

Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/0jVn__d-3oQ?si=XUJVJKnNS0ElJflJ) demonstrating the application and the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07200) introducing the technique used by the tool called MLDTW.
